# Carlos Buil-Aranda

Assistant Professor at  [Departamento de Informática](https://www.inf.utfsm.cl) at [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://www.usm.cl/) and Young Researcher at [Instituto Milenio de Fundamentos de los Datos](https://imfd.cl/).

15+ years of experience in research (~5 of them in industry) mostly working with knowledge graphs. My background focuses mainly in graph data management, including backend optimization, query visualization, data integration using ontologies and data privacy, among other topics.  I have also been editor of the W3C [SPARQL 1.1 Federation Extension](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).


Originally I'm from Spain, and I came to Chile during 2010 to work with Marcelo Arenas during my PhD at [Ontology Engineering Group](http://www.oeg-upm.net/). My PhD supervisor was Óscar Corcho, and I will always be grateful for all the support he gave me, and everything I learnt during that period. By the end of 2018 I got my Chilean nationality, so right now I have two nationalities: Spanish and Chilean.


## My students

Beyond the publishing work I have to do, I'm specially proud of the work my students and I have achieved. Without them, I wouldn't be here.

### Master students

 - Daniel Casals: ongoing work on using machine learning to improve SPARQL endpoints performance.
 
 - Hernán Vargas: [RDFExplorer](https://www.rdfexplorer.org), [Git repo](https://gitlab.com/imfd-public/rdfexplorer/) we developed a Visual Query Builder for SPARQL. By using RDFExplorer we allow lay users that know nothing about RDF or SPARQL to query these RDF data through an SPARQL endpoint. Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)
 
 - Maximiliano Osorio: [Dockerpedia](https://dockerpedia.inf.utfsm.cl) [Git repo](https://github.com/dockerpedia) An annotation system for Docker images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) using [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair). Another undergrad student (Tomás González) extended Dockerpedia to be able to process [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/) images. We are now using Dockerpedia to reproduce scientific experiments (data workflow based experiments). Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
