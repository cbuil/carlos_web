# Carlos Buil-Aranda

Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience in industry and research. My research focuses on Knowledge Graphs and graph data management, including: backend optimization, query visualization, data integration, and data privacy. As part of my international research I edited  the W3C SPARQL 1.1 Federation Extension. Winner of three international awards and best PhD in Computer Science from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

Originally I'm from Spain, and I came to Chile during 2010 to work with Marcelo Arenas during my PhD at [Ontology Engineering Group](http://www.oeg-upm.net/). My PhD supervisor was Óscar Corcho, and I will always be grateful for all the support he gave me, and everything I learnt during that period. By the end of 2018 I got my Chilean nationality, so right now I have two nationalities: Spanish and Chilean.


## My students

Beyond the publishing work I have to do, I'm specially proud of the work my students and I have achieved. Without them, I wouldn't be here.

### Master students

 - Daniel Casals: ongoing work on using machine learning to improve SPARQL endpoints performance.
 
 - Hernán Vargas: [RDFExplorer](https://www.rdfexplorer.org), [Git repo](https://gitlab.com/imfd-public/rdfexplorer/) we developed a Visual Query Builder for SPARQL. By using RDFExplorer we allow lay users that know nothing about RDF or SPARQL to query these RDF data through an SPARQL endpoint. Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)
 
 - Maximiliano Osorio: [Dockerpedia](https://dockerpedia.inf.utfsm.cl) [Git repo](https://github.com/dockerpedia) An annotation system for Docker images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) using [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair). Another undergrad student (Tomás González) extended Dockerpedia to be able to process [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/) images. We are now using Dockerpedia to reproduce scientific experiments (data workflow based experiments). Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
